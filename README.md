Table of Contents:
1. Importing Data and Libraries  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Data Scaling, Encoding, and Preprocessing  
4. Random Forest Classification Model  
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification Model  
6. Classification Using Azure Machine Learning  

Importing Data and Libraries:
- Import libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.
- Load the dataset for analysis and model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- View dataset structure and check its size.
- Handle missing values by replacing them with column means.
- Generate statistics and check for duplicates.
- Visualize distributions of numerical and categorical features.

Data Scaling, Encoding, and Preprocessing:
- Separate the dataset into features and target variables.
- Apply preprocessing techniques to handle numerical and categorical data.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Prepare the dataset for machine learning.

Random Forest Classification Model:
- Train a Random Forest classifier using training data.
- Evaluate the model using a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC score.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification Model:
- Train the SVM classifier on the dataset.
- Evaluate the model using the confusion matrix and relevant metrics.
